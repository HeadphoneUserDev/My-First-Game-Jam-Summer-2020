Please do checkout my method of switching weapons in the Player_01 sript
if you have a better method of doing it, I'd be really happy if you would help out as i might use that method in the future

Goal:
I want the player to change weapons by random everytime it gets hit by an enemy
Until I figured out how to implement it, it would be nice if you could help out speed up the process
